Meshes have 19134 tris.
===Unity Materials description===
Toad has two materials "Toad_MatBody" and "Toad_MatEyes". "Toad_MatEyes" is transparent. It is intended for EyeLids, EYELRog, EYERRog only. "Toad_MatBody" is intended for all another ones.
"Plane_Mat" is intended for Plane in demo scene only. Toad_MatBody textures are 4k and Toad_MatEyes  textures are 2k.
===Unity animations description===
Model have blendshapes.
All animations except the "Jump" are in-place.
All animations except the "ToadRig_AttackDeath", "ToadRig_WaterAttackDeath" are Looped.
Animations, wich are contained if fbx files and starting with a letter "Z" You shouldn't use.

All antmations can be divided into 4 groups: Idle, Walk, Attack, Water animations.

===Idle===
For Idle animations in Unity Animator Controller I added "IdleInt" parameter. It takes values from 1 to 5.
if its value equals       1     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_IdleBreath"
if its value equals       2     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_IdleBreathBlink"
if its value equals       3     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_IdleScratch"
if its value equals       4     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_IdleLookBack"
if its value equals       5     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_IdleSleep"

There is also "IdleSitHypnoInt" parameter. It takes values from 1 to 4.
if its value equals       1     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_IdleBreath"
if its value equals       2     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_IdleSit"
if its value equals       3     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_IdleSitSwing"
if its value equals       4     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_IdleHypnojaba"

"IdleWalkJumpInt"  takes values from 1 to 3
if its value equals       1     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_IdleBreath"
if its value equals       2     then commits transition to state     "WalkBlendTree"
if its value equals       3     then commits transition to state     "Jump"


WalkBlendTree consists of three trees. "Toad_AnimController.controller_Mouse_BF_BlendTree" is just a copy of  "Mouse_BF_BlendTree" (you can find this tree in the "Toad" folder).
It is assumed that the "BF" (BackForward) parameter matches the up and down keys of keyboard, "LR" to left and right keys, "Mouse" to turn mouse left and right.

===Attack===
AttackBool parameter is condition for transition from Idle to Attack group of animations.

AttackInt parameter takes values from 1 to 9.
if its value equals       1     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_IdleBreath0"
if its value equals       2     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_AttackJaws"
if its value equals       3     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_AttackJawsL"
if its value equals       4     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_AttackJawsR"
if its value equals       5     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_AttackTongue"
if its value equals       6     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_AttackJawsBigPray"
if its value equals       7     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_AttackThreat"
if its value equals       8     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_AttackDamage"
if its value equals       9     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_AttackDeath"


===Water===
"WaterBool" parameter is condition for transition from Idle to Water group of animations.

"WaterInt" takes values from 1 to 8
if its value equals       1     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_WaterIdle"
if its value equals       2     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_WaterSwim"
if its value equals       3     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_WaterSwimBack"
if its value equals       4     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_WaterIdleBlink"
if its value equals       5     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_WaterAttackJaws"
if its value equals       6     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_WaterAttackTongue"
if its value equals       7     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_WaterAttackDamage"
if its value equals       8     then commits transition to state     "ToadRig_WaterAttackDeath"
